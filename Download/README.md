<h1>Download</h1>

If you would like to play Billiards without compiling the C++, you can download these files. <br>
Bear in mind, however, that this will only work for Windows.

Make sure to place them in the same folder. <br>
You may wish to create a shortcut to the executable file (`.exe`) so that you can access the game from a folder that doesn't contain the text files.

When developing the project, I did not account for `Help.txt` and `Credits.txt` not being present, so if you try to select these options from the menu 
without the corresponding text file, the program will crash.

You do not need to download `README.md`.
