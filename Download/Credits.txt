David created the One Lone Coder Pixel Game Engine, a C++ header file that defines a namespace and a class that allows me to create a window and draw to it. Without the OLCPGE, Billiards would not be possible.
Kate helped me design the table and the background in the game. She is responsible for the colours that you see in-game.
